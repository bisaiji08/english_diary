<p>
  Your tree represents your progress in using English Diary. Here's how it works:
</p>

<h3>Watering Your Tree</h3>
<p>
  The first diary you write each day is considered as "watering" your tree. Watering helps your tree grow and level up, encouraging consistent daily engagement. 
</p>
<p>
  Even if you write multiple diaries in a single day, only the first diary will count as watering. This ensures a focus on daily practice rather than quantity.
</p>

<h3>Watering Frequency</h3>
<p>
  Watering can only be done once per day. If you skip a day without writing a diary, your tree won't receive water for that day, and its growth will pause. Check the "Tree Information" section on your My Page to see if you've watered your tree for the day.
</p>
